## IPFS

Initially the models were uploaded to IPFS as a folder. Those can be found here: ipfs://bafybeiem5gn34ejnmbb3idbc7hszmprqrc3zvpintn7o6fyxcqts7f3fxi/
Metadata for these models are at: ipfs://bafybeihjmhtclyhigayikvzoxd7jc5gciqzbtobvdbhani5xmq7bd4uita/
[The models after 0 are 3D models of .glb format]


Now to allow users to mint NFTs with new textures for gun models, we're allowing the NFT to be minted with a `tokenURI`.
